# _proj-Predict-Bike-Sharing-Patterns
## Basic Neural Network for Predicting Bike Sharing

This was an early project in the Udacity curriculum in which we constructed a simple fully connected neural net, c/w hand coded activation functions (sigmoid for non-linearity), and excluded the use of any deep learning frameworks.
